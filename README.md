# CSE-316-Microprocessors-and-Microcontrollers-Sessional
This is a Hardware Project on Microprocessors and Microcontrollers.  
We used **ATMega32** as our main Microcontroller and made a **Smart Watering System** for plants.  
This project is based on the idea of measuring humidity level of soil and also the temperature and water the plants automatically. This can be useful in a case when people go outside for a long time and the plants at their home needs watering.  
Also, this idea can be implemented in large nursery where manual watering can be very tiresome.
